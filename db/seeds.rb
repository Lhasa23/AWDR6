      <em>Build, Ship, and Run Your Applications Everywhere</em>
      Docker does for DevOps what Rails did for web development—it gives you
      a new set of superpowers. Gone are “works on my machine” woes and lengthy
      setup tasks, replaced instead by a simple, consistent, Docker-based
      development environment that will have your team up and running in seconds.
      Gain hands-on, real-world experience with a tool that’s rapidly becoming
      fundamental to software development. Go from zero all the way to production
      as Docker transforms the massive leap of deploying your app in the cloud
      into a baby step.

      <em>Responsive, Intuitive Interfaces with Ruby</em>
      The next step in the evolution of user interfaces is here.
      Chatbots let your users interact with your service in their
      own natural language. Use free and open source tools along
      with Ruby to build creative, useful, and unexpected interactions
      for users. Take advantage of the Lita framework’s step-by-step
      implementation strategy to simplify bot development and testing.
      From novices to experts, chatbots are an area in which everyone
      can participate. Exercise your creativity by creating chatbot
      skills for communicating, information, and fun.

      <em>Create High-Performance, Safe, Concurrent Apps</em>
      Crystal is for Ruby programmers who want more performance or for
      developers who enjoy working in a high-level scripting environment. Crystal
      combines native execution speed and concurrency with Ruby-like syntax, so
      you will feel right at home. This book, the first available on Crystal,
      shows you how to write applications that have the beauty and elegance of a
      modern language, combined with the power of types and modern concurrency
      tooling. Now you can write beautiful code that runs faster, scales better,
      and is a breeze to deploy.
